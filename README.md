# Car Grab Coin
Be a car. Grab some coins. Play the original, by [@WishlistKarls on Scratch.](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/WishlistKarls/)

So, I thought it would be funny to remaster the game in GameMaker Studio.

## Some Info
Things you should know: 
- Main Releases will be uploaded on itch.io, not here. See my itch.io [here.](https://ramendoodles.itch.io/)
- Minor Updates, Demos, and Bugfixes will be uploaded to the repository here.
- Bugfixes will have a '-f' followed by the issue number (if from an issue) and the fix number appended to the version number.
- Beta Demos will have a '-b' appended to the version number.
- Alpha Demos will have a '-a' appended to the version number.

## About Demos and Bugfixes
Beta Demos are demos with features that are close to completion, that I want feedback on before I complete them.<br>
Alpha Demos are for features that are ideas and are not close to completion, and I want to know if I should include them or not.<br>
Open an issue detailing a bug and it will be resolved with a bugfix in a day or so.<br>
<br>
The demos I upload here will come in two file formats:
- YYZ - GameMaker Project File. Open in GameMaker.
- EXE - Exported Project. Compressed installer* for easy download.

*Note: When installing the EXE, it is recommended to install to a folder you use alot, for easy deletion after use.

## About Opening Issues
